- 👋 Hi, I’m @ELB52
- 👀 I’m interested in automation, functional software test, crypto and blockchain development and integration.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning solidity and refreshing my C++ skills (which are a bit rusty).  I spent the past few 
years at Rockwell Automation with the Customer Response Team (CRT), working with firmware functional test 
responsibilities as they relate to rolling-out incremental firmware versions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on blockchain, dApp and crypto related projects.
- 📫 How to reach me is via email preferred.
